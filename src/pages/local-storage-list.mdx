# Local Storage List

Built on top of the [@corets/list](/list) package and provides an integration with `localStorage`. Can be used as a drop in replacement for lists from the other package.

```bash
yarn add @corets/local-storage-list
```

## React

Example of how to use lists in React:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { createLocalStorageList } from "@corets/local-storage-list"
import { useList } from "@corets/use-list"

const Example = () => {
  const list = useList(() => createLocalStorageList("storageKey", ["apple", "banana"]))

  const addFruit = () => list.add("pineapple")

  return (
    <div>
      Fruits: {list.get().join(",")}
      <button onClick={addFruit}>Add fruit</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `createLocalStorageList`

Create a new list:

```ts
import { createLocalStorageList } from "@corets/local-storage-list"

const list = createLocalStorageList("storageKey", ["some", "data"])
```
