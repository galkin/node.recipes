# Starter for new packages

This package provides a minimal and opinionated setup for @corets libraries. You can choose a setup for a TypeScript only, or a TypeScript + React library.

```bash
yarn global add create-corets-starter
```

To scaffold a new package you can run any of the commands below:

```bash
# scaffold using yarn
yarn create corets-starter

# scaffold using npm
npm create corets-starter

# scaffold using npx
npx create-corets-starter

# scaffold if installed globally
create-corets-starter
```

This is what the setup process looks like:

<ImageFrame src={require("../../public/create-corets-starter.gif")} />
