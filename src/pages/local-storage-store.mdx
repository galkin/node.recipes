# Local Storage Store

Built on top of the [@corets/store](/store) package and provides an integration with `localStorage`. Can be used as a drop in replacement for stores from the other package.

```bash
yarn add @corets/local-storage-store
```

## React

Example of how to use stores in React:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { createLocalStorageStore } from "@corets/local-storage-store"
import { useStore } from "@corets/use-store"

const Example = () => {
  const counterStore = useStore(() => createLocalStorageStore("storageKey", { counter: 0 }))

  const increment = () => counterStore.set({ counter: counterStore.get().counter + 1 })

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>{counterStore.get().counter}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `createLocalStorageStore`

Create a new store:

```ts
import { createLocalStorageStore } from "@corets/local-storage-store"

const store = createLocalStorageStore("storageKey", { some: "data" })
```
