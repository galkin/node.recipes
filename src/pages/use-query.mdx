# Use Query

Convenient hooks for url query segments, built for [`react-router`](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start). Working with queries is now as easy as using `useState`.

```bash
yarn add @corets/use-query
```

## `useQuery`

Hook into URL query and update it easily from withing your component:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useQuery } from "@corets/use-query"

const Example = () => {
  const [query, setQuery, patchQuery] = useQuery({
    page: 1,
    order: "asc"
  })

  // update page and also reset order to the initial value "asc"
  const handleGoToNextPage = () => setQuery({ page: query.page + 1 })
  // update order, but keep page as is
  const handleToggleSort = () => patchQuery({ order: query.order === "asc" ? "desc" : "asc" })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Page: {query.page}</div>
      <div>Order: {query.order}</div>
      <button onClick={handleGoToNextPage}>Go to next page</button>
      <button onClick={handleToggleSort}>Change sorting order</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

By default, parameters like `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `0` and `"0"` are stripped, the default value will be used instead. Updating query with one of those values won't change anything. You can alter this behaviour by providing a second argument, overriding values that should be stripped away:

```ts
useQuery({ some: "value" }, ["", null, undefined])
```
