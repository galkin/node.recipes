# Tag

Type *tagging* (also known as *branding*) is a common practice in advanced TypeScript setups. The main purpose of this approach is to make certain primitive types more predictable. Using branded types leads to a better traceability of data in the project and encourages developers to be more *aware* when working with critical, primitive data.

```bash
yarn add @corets/tag
```

## Quick Start

Let's have a look at this example below:

```ts
type UUID = string

type User = {
  id: UUID
}
```

We have created a type alias `UUID` that is used on the type `User`. Any `string` value is a valid `UUID`:

```ts
const user: User = { id: "some-uuid" }
```

This is very implicit, not traceable, and is not very *safe* since you pay less attention to what is passed around, since everything is just a `string`.

What if we could make this more explicit?

```ts
import { Tag } from "@corets/tag"

type UUID = Tag<string, "uuid">

type User = {
    id: UUID
}

// this will not work since string is not assignable to UUID
const user1: User = { id: "some-uuid" }

// exlicitly cast it to UUID
const user2: User = { id: "some-uuid" as UUID }
```

Now we are using a branded `string` instead of plain `string`. You cannot assign a plain `string` to a `UUID` anymore, if you do so, you have to cast it explicitly. Now you also have full traceability on where `UUID`s are used in the project.

**Note:** You can go even further and add some type guards, a factory function, etc. for tagged types, but this is not covered here.

## `Tag<type, alias>`

Creates a *branded* type for any kind of primitive values:

```ts
import { Tag } from "@corets/tag"

const Email = Tag<string, "email">

// this will work
const email2: Email = "foo@bar.com" as Email
// this will not work
const email1: Email = "foo@bar.com"
```

**Note:** You get full traceability of where *branded* types are used in your project, since you always have to cast a primitive value to that specific type!
