# Use Throttle

Create a throttled version of a specific value or a function.

```bash
yarn add @corets/use-throttle
```

## `useThrottle`

This hook is built on top of lodash's [`throttle()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle) and accepts the same arguments.

In this example we are creating a throttled version of an existing value:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { useThrottle } from "@corets/use-throttle"

const Example = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("")
  const throttledInput = useThrottle(input, 300)

  const handleSearch = () => {
    // fetch some data based on input...
  }

  const handleChange = (e) => setInput(e.target.value)

  // react to changes of the debounced input
  useEffect(handleSearch, [throttledInput])

  return (
    <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
  )
}
```

In this example we are creating a throttled version of a function:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { useThrottle } from "@corets/use-throttle"

const Example = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("")
  const handleSearch = useThrottle((query: string) => {
    // you can also access variable "input" directly, if you want to
    // fetch some data based on input...
  }, 300)

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInput(e.target.value)
    // trigger search immediately, this call will be throttled
    handleSearch(e.target.value)
  }


  return (
    <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
  )
}
```

**Note:** This hook accepts a third `options` argument identical to the one expected by lodash's [`throttle()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle) function.
